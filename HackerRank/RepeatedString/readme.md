# Repeated String

There is a string, *s* , of lowercase English letters that is repeated infinitely many times. Given an integer,*n* , find and print the number of letter a's in the first *n* letters of the infinite string.



#### Example 1:

```c++
s = 'abcac'
n = 10
```
The substring we consider is *abcacabcac*, the first **10** characters of the infinite string.

There are **4** occurrences of a in the substring.



#### Function Description

Complete the repeatedString function in the editor below.

repeatedString has the following parameter(s):

```c++
s: a string to repeat
n: the number of characters to consider
```

#### Returns
```c++
int: the frequency of a in the substring
```

#### Input Format

The first line contains a single string, *s*.

The second line contains an integer, *n*.


#### Constraints:
```c++
1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^12
```
For 25% of the test cases, *n* ≤ 10^6.



### Sample Input
```c++
aba
10
```

### Sample Output
```c++
7
```

### Explanation of sample output
The first *n* = 10 letters of the infinite string are c++`abaabaabaa`. Because there are 7 a's, we return 7.
