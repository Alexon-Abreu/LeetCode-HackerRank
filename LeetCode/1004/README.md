# 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III (Medium)

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`'s in the array if you can flip at most `k` `0`'s.

#### Example 1:

```Python
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
                        ^         ^
                     Flipped   Flipped
