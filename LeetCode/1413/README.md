# 1413. Minimum Value to Get Positive Step by Step Sum (Easy)

Given an array of integers `nums`, you start with an initial **positive** value *startValue*.

In each iteration, you calculate the step by step sum of *startValue* plus elements in `nums` (from left to right).

Return the minimum **positive** value of `startValue` such that the step by step sum is never less than 1.
