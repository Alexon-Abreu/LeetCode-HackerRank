# 1557. Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes (Medium)

Given a **directed acyclic graph**, with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from[i], to[i]]` represents a directed edge from node from[i] to node to[i].

Find the *smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable*. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.

#### Example 1:

```c++
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,5],[3,4],[4,2]]
Output: [0,3]
Explanation: It's not possible to reach all the nodes from a single vertex. From 0 we can reach [0,1,2,5]. From 3 we can reach [3,4,2,5]. So we output [0,3].
```


#### Example 2:

```c++

```

#### Constraints:
